# ML_Election_Analysis
Comprehensive Machine Learning Analysis: Predicting party affiliations of voters in elections using logistic regression, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, and ensemble methods. Additionally, an exploration of presidential inaugural speeches to derive insights on word usage, stopwords, and frequent terms

# Comprehensive Machine Learning Analysis and Text Exploration

## Project Overview
This project encompasses two distinct problem-solving scenarios. The first involves predicting voter party affiliations in elections using various machine learning techniques. The second delves into exploring and deriving insights from presidential inaugural speeches using Python. The results are encapsulated in both Python scripts and a business report presented in PDF format.

## Repository Contents
- `ML_Election_Analysis/`: Folder containing the Python scripts for the election analysis.
- `Inaugural_Speech_Exploration/`: Folder containing the Python scripts for the text exploration.
- `business_report.pdf`: PDF presentation consolidating findings from both analyses.
